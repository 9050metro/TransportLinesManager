ASSET SELECTION BY LINE PREFIX

    - Now ship lines appear in transportation view (in a weird way, but they are there - should be improved soon)

    - Now the TLM icon isn't show in the Info Panel anymore
BUG FIXING
    - Now the number of line is used correctly in prefixed lines which doesn't use auto color by prefix.
    - Other minor bugs fixed.
