    -Budget controls refactoring
    -Fixed: the dynamic budget change between the hours ranges isn't working smoothly
    -Temp Fix: Now all transport modal tabs appears for everyone, despite not having the DLC's (note the transport system's funcionality will be missing in that cases)
    -Removed redundant old non-prefixed palette (now can be setted at the prefix options)
    -Fixed: the Labels of the prefix panel aren't fitting in the space correctly at first load
    -Fixed: zeroed ticket price behaviour now is to inherit from parent layer (in order: line price -> prefix price -> default city price -> default game price)
