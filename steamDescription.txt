[h1]NOTE ABOUT IMPROVED PUBLIC TRANSPORT 2 [IPT2] [/h1]

The TLM Team is working to bring some functions from IPT to the TLM. Stay tuned!
Also, Bloody Penguin is working in IPT and some incompatibilities shall vanish soon.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A shortcut to manage all city's public transports lines. Useful for Airplane Line Tool and Ship Line Tool also.

[h1]Why reborned?[/h1]
The TLM now is not a project solo, is a community project. You can contribute to improve this mod checking out the mod sources at GitHub:

Feel free to use them in another mod. Just tell what you used in your mod credits.

[h1]How does this work[/h1]

The tabs of lines detail window now have a different form for each line type:

- [i]Hexagons[/i] are regular buses lines
- [i]Circles[/i] are train lines
- [i]Squares[/i] are metro/subway lines
- [i]Diamonds[/i] are ship lines. (Since 4.3)
- [i]Trapezes[/i] are tram lines. (Snowfall/Since 4.5)
- [i]Pentagons[/i] are airplane lines. (Since 5.1)
- [i]Parachutes[/i] are blimp lines. (Since 6.0)
- [i]Stars[/i] are ferry lines. (Since 6.0)
- [i]Rounded Squares[/i] are monorail lines. (Since 6.0)

And more things have changed:

- [i]The asterisk tab[/i] was removed. Now you can use the [i]gears button[/i] to change the prefix options (prices, budgets, models...)
- [i]The factory icon button[/i] switches between the lines listing and the depot listing.

[h1]IPT Overridden Functions:[/h1]
- You can choose which vehicle models will be spawned in each line (by [b]line prefix[/b] in the asterisk tab; since 5.0)
- You can see where in the line are each vehicle in a graphic view, after accessing the line detail menu (since 4.2)
- You can select how many vehicles will be used in a line. (in the line detail view; since 5.1)
- You can set an multiplier for certain lines budget  (by [b]line prefix[/b] in asterisk tab; Since 5.2)
- You can set the ticket price from 0.05 up to 40 C  (by [b]line prefix[/b] in asterisk tab; since 5.3)
  (Game defaults: Bus= 1; Tram, Train, Metro = 2; Ship = 5; Airplane = 10)


[h1]AND MORE![/h1]
- You can set the budget by time of the day, in 3 hours length groups!
- You can see all integrations of lines in each station in the linear view - in the line detail panel;
- You can edit stop names directly from linear view, just click on the labels and set its name. Works for buses and trams too!
- You can see which lines serves around a building by clicking on it - with shortcuts for the line detail view;
- You can set the internal number of lines and format how it's shown as you want too.
- You can modify many line at once putting they in the same prefix and editing its prefix options on asterisk menu (includes budget, fares and models)
- TLM have an more friendly graphical view of the city lines, in the linear view or exporting a map with the city lines (this last function is in alpha)

[h1]NEW AT 6.0[/h1]

- Support for mass transit
- Now shows external trains stations with a orange circle with a symbol (same model used for taxis, airports and ports)
- Now uses road names for bus and tram stations and line namings(if near a crossing, show name as [i]Street A x Avenue B[/i])


[h1]Important Notes[/h1]
- Due the overriding done in the Tram, Ship, Bus and Passenger Train system, the option of enable/disable vehicles from these categories inside the [i]Advanced Vehicle Options[/i] is useless for public city lines. The configuration in the TLM override it. But all other functions, like coloring, set capacity and more of AVO are still working. The model selection for external vehicles (like regional passenger ships and trains) still workin in AVO and alike mods.
- Due the overriding done in the Tram, Ship, Bus and Passenger Train system, the IPT enqueue for these categories will fail: the model of the bus enqueued could not be the selected in IPT. Use the compatibility mode for IPT to avoid it.
- No new incompatibilities found, except the listed above.


[h1]Known Bugs[/h1]
- Rename depots are not working in the TLM listing and in depot details windows.
- Bus stations and terminals are wrongly listed as depots.
- Not show cable car stations on linear map as near transport

[h1](Alpha) Transport map exporter[/h1]
When active, a [i]Draw Map![/i] button will appear mod options menu. When clicked, the game generates a map with the metro and train lines like the linear map style. 
The html files with the map can be found at Transport Lines Manager folder inside game root folder (steamapps/common/Cities Skylines).

[h1]Next steps:[/h1]
- Integrate IPT 2.
